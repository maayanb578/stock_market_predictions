# 1) Introduction

Forecasting stock prices is a cumbersome task because it does not follow a specific pattern. Changes in stock prices are based solely on supply and demand during a certain period. In order to learn the specific characteristics of a stock price, we can use machine learning to identify these patterns. One of the most well-known models for forecasting a series of continuous numbers is "linear regression", thus making them extremely useful for stock prediction. prices. But in this project, I trained four models for stock prediction and finally the error rate returns. Successfully predicting the future price of a stock may yield a significant profit.



# 2) Stock Market Data

The primary data we will use for this model is taken directly from the Yahoo Finance page that contains the latest market data on a specific stock price. To do this easily using Python, with the help of a function I built specifically for this which performs scraping on the site and will allow us to download all the information we need about a given ticker symbol.




Below is a sample screenshot of the ticker symbol (AAPL) that we will use in this stock prediction article:
